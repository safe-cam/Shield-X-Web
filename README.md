Converted web app (first pass)

This folder contains a Vite React app converted from the React Native project. It mirrors screens and styles closely using React + CSS.

How to run (Windows cmd.exe):

```cmd
cd converted-web
npm install
npm run dev
```

What I converted:
- Full `Home` screen (matching layout and panic button behavior)
- Basic pages for Login, Signup, Chat, Location, Alerts, Evidence as placeholders wired into the router
- Shared CSS closely matching the React Native styles

Next steps I can do on request:
- Add exact icon replacements and interactive navigation bar
- Implement map (Location) using Leaflet or Google Maps
- Implement file upload for Evidence and integrate API endpoints
- Convert remaining screens with fidelity and accessibility improvements

If you want me to continue and convert every RN screen precisely to web components (no RN imports), tell me and I will proceed screen-by-screen.
